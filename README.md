List of games I have played with my status/impressions

Returned games
- ravenswatch - nice graphics, hard gameplay, the lack of rewards on each (long) play makes death too punishing - returned due to dificulty
- astroneer - the cameras dont provide proper adjustements, positiong and building is hard - returned due to cameras
